# Todo Task Web Portal

This is a simple web portal for managing your to-do tasks. It has been created using only HTML and CSS, without the use of a database. This means that the tasks will not persist across sessions, and they will be lost when the web page is refreshed or closed.

## Features

- Add new tasks: You can enter a task description and click the "Add" button to add it to the list of tasks.
- Remove tasks: You can click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Responsive design: The web portal is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, allowing for a consistent user experience across devices.

## Getting Started

To use this web portal, simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file. Then, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No additional installation or setup is required.

## Limitations

Since this web portal does not utilize a database, the tasks are stored only in the browser's memory during the current session. This means that:

- Tasks will be lost when the web page is refreshed or closed.
- The tasks are not accessible from multiple devices or browsers.
- There is no data synchronization between different sessions.
